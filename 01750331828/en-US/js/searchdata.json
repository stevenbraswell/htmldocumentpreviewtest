Never start up the system without filling piece and additional metal sheets.  WARNING   Risk of impact Be careful not to injure your head when the fasciaor the rear dooris opened.   Move carefully when either the fascia or the rear door is opened.   DANGER   Adverse weather conditions Make sure that no water\/liquids (e.g. rain, snow etc.) gets into the open system and the exposed components, especially under adverse weather conditions, since that could pose a danger to your life. Be sure to take suitable precautions when working on an open system (e.g. by covering components where necessary) so that fluid cannot enter the open system.    For reasons of stability, the system must be screwed to the load-bearing substructure of the installation site or mounted on a suitable base.    If the system is brought from a cold environment into the warm operating room, condensation can occur. Allow the system to acclimatize before connecting it to the main voltage.    Only use the original packaging material to transport the system.    Observe the warning and information labels on the system.    Unless otherwise stated, grasp the components only by the green control elements when handling them.    This system is equipped with a safety-tested power cable which must be connected to a suitable grounded socket only.    Always hold the plug when removing the power cable. Never pull on the cable itself.    Lay all connecting cables in such a way that they will not be stepped on or tripped over, damaged or crushed in any way.    Have damaged power cables replaced immediately.    Make sure that there is always free access to the electrical sockets used or to the electrical circuit-breakers of the facility installation.  DANGER   In case of an emergency (e.g. damaged cabinets, controls or power cables, liquids or foreign objects in the system) take the following steps: Switch the system voltage-free immediately by:   Switching off the automatic circuit breaker or removing the fuse insert from the fuse holder in the distributor box of the facility installation. Disconnecting the plug of the power supply cable from the grounded socket in the facility installation. Interrupting the power connection between the UPS (uninterruptible power supply) and the system (see chapter \"Introduction\", section \"General power interruption\" in the operating manual); For further system-specific notes, please refer to the operating manuals. Inform the customer service responsible for you.    Never connect or disconnect data transmission lines during a thunderstorm.    Always keep the system’s ventilation openings free from obstruction to ensure proper ventilation and to prevent malfunctions resulting from overheating.

Practically all of the FRUs of the DN Series system family are electronically identifiable via the stored data in the component. The service technician can have the data displayed directly on the system via T\/SOP or via remote inquiry. Parts of the inventory data are available on an additional identification shield on the respective component. This information can also be read in electronically via a 2D barcode.  Identification label The individual HWI information is stored either in the respective FRU or on a nearby FRU. In the event of direct storage in the FRU, a data memory provided expressly for that purpose is used. In the event of a replacement, all HWI information will remain at the component in this case. If the HWI information is stored on a different FRU, then it will be available only in virtual form in the event of a hardware replacement, and will not remain in the component itself. In the event a service technician is called in, all of the available HWI data of the system will be assembled automatically via CrypTA and transferred afterwards to a central database. This way, important information is available via remote inquiry and can be used for evaluations, planning and analyses.

This so-called Trusted Device Communication procedure (TDC) is comprised of various encryption procedures (e.g. Secure Channel or SPEAR), which are used automatically, depending on the system and the component. The encryption of the components is based on an exchange of certificates which are stored on the components. The certificates are loaded into the components in a secure environment at the factory. A personalization is involved in which certificates are loaded in the Trusted Platform Module logic board (TPM). The certificates are not permitted to be altered in the field. The loss or alteration of the certificates leads to mandatory replacement of the respective component. Provisioning in the field is not possible.

For some of the cash components (e.g. RM4), it is necessary to carry out the encryption on the T\/SOP manually. The absence of an encryption and the required action steps are displayed when the T\/SOP is called up. The activation can be carried out without CrypTA dongle, the prerequisite for this is an open safe door.

This means that crucial criteria such as long life, choice of material and its labeling, energy efficiency, emissions, packaging, ease of disassembly and recyclability have been taken into account. This conserves resources and lessens the impact on the environment.  Saving energy Please switch on Systems that need not be constantly running only when they are actually needed. They should also be turned off when they are not needed for longer periods of time and at the end of work.  Disposing of used consumables Please dispose of printer consumables, used batteries as well as cleaning and maintenance materials in accordance with national regulations (where relevant complying with vendor specifications).        Used batteries should not be disposed of as normal municipal waste within the EU (crossed-out wheeled bin symbol). The chemical names of certain pollutants, if included in the batteries, can be found underneath the symbol of the crossed-out wheeled bin. Examples here include: (Pb) lead, (Cd) cadmium and (Hg) mercury. Used batteries can be disposed of free of charge throughout the EU.    Labels on plastic parts of the housing Please do not stick any labels on plastic parts of the housing since that would make recycling more difficult.  Returning, remarketing, recycling and disposal Details regarding the return and recycling of systems and consumables can be obtained from your local branch office.

This means that crucial criteria such as long life, choice of material and its labeling, energy efficiency, emissions, packaging, ease of disassembly and recyclability have been taken into account. This conserves resources and lessens the impact on the environment.  Saving energy Please switch on Systems that need not be constantly running only when they are actually needed. They should also be turned off when they are not needed for longer periods of time and at the end of work.  Disposing of used consumables Please dispose of printer consumables, used batteries as well as cleaning and maintenance materials in accordance with national regulations (where relevant complying with vendor specifications).        Used batteries should not be disposed of as normal municipal waste within the EU (crossed-out wheeled bin symbol). The chemical names of certain pollutants, if included in the batteries, can be found underneath the symbol of the crossed-out wheeled bin. Examples here include: (Pb) lead, (Cd) cadmium and (Hg) mercury. Used batteries can be disposed of free of charge throughout the EU.    Labels on plastic parts of the housing Please do not stick any labels on plastic parts of the housing since that would make recycling more difficult.
